- need to separate start from end to finish what has been done in marimo notebook
- put the combination of matrices in a function
- replace right upper part with zeros matrix (easier to optimize after)
- use the big matrix to build the GNN 
- simulate the distance for order preparation 
- train the GNN
- invert the GNN to have best values on edges for the item loc part
- look at the distance
- iterate
